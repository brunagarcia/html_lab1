            <h3>Bio:</h3>
            <p>Here is Bruna, I start studying computer science almost a decade ago, 
               I've been always a passionate person, no matter what I'm doing, throughout
               my life I've had a chance to study not just computer science but also Graphic
               Design, Marketing and Advertising and Video Production and in each of those 
               areas I could realize how technology is important and it's changing us and 
               the way we live. On my free time, I'm a sci-fi nerd and a pug mom... 
               I love to talk, share experience and learn new stuff.</p>
